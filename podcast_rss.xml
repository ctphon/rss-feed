        <title><![CDATA[[But Why] How much does the moon weigh?]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[We?re bringing back an episode from the archives, all about the moon: Why does the moon change shape? How much does it weigh? What color is it? Why does the Earth only have one moon? Why does it have holes? Where does it go when we can't see it? Why do we sometimes see it in the daytime? And why does the moon look like it's following you when you're in the car? Answers to your moon questions with John O'Meara, chief scientist at the W.M. Keck Observatory. Download our learning guides: PDF | Google Slide | Transcript | Coloring Page We can see the moon during the day for the same reason we see the moon at night. The surface of the moon is reflecting the sun's light into our eyes. But we don't see the moon all the time during the day, and that's because of where the moon might be in the sky. There are times where the moon is on the other side of the earth so we can?t see it. We see the moon in the sky when it?s in the right spot and it?s reflecting enough light to be brighter than the background of the sky. The moon is a satellite. A satellite is something that moves or rotates around a planet, the earth in this case. The moon is 239,000 miles away. That's far, but it's way closer than any of the other stars or planets you can see in the night sky. That's why the moon looks so big compared to other celestial objects even though the stars are actually much bigger. The moon weighs 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds. That?s a lot! But it?s such a big number it?s hard to imagine how much that weighs. Instead, think about how much the moon weighs compared to the Earth. It turns out that the moon is about 1% percent the mass of the earth. That?s a lot! When you?re in a car and it feels like the moon is following you, what you?re actually seeing is an optical illusion. The moon is very far away, compared to anything else you see when you're driving ? like the telephone poles that appear to fly past your car as you're going down a highway. But the moon is so far away that its size and shape in the sky doesn?t change, so it feels like the moon is following you.]]></description>

Her name was Bessie Coleman, and she was the very first Black female pilot. She figured out how to make old, rickety planes do amazing things. Bessie pushed the limits of the sky and inspired aviators for years to come. This podcast is a production of Rebel Girls and is based on the book series Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls.

        <title><![CDATA[[But Why] Do skyscrapers scrape the sky?]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[Why is the Burj Khalifa so tall? That?s what 5-year-old Simon wants to know. The Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world and it?s located in Dubai. 6-year-old Isabel, who lives in Dubai, visited the tower and gives us the bird?s eye view in this episode! Plus, Janny G?d?on, architecture educator and founder of ArchForKids answers lots more questions about tall buildings: How are tall buildings built? How do they stay up? Why are so many buildings squares or rectangles? How do they make buildings that are taller than cranes? Resources Architecture workshops and online learning: ArchForKids Download our learning guides: PDF | Google Slides | Transcript Why is the Burj Khalifa so tall? - Simon, 5, Chicago The Burj Khalifa is 160 stories tall. It measures over 2,716 feet tall ? or if you think in metric that?s 828 meters. ?If you put 450 grown ups stacked on top of each other, that would be the height of the building,? Janny Gedeon says. Architecture is the science of designing buildings. Architects consider the purpose of the building and what it will be used for and then they design that space. Square and rectangular buildings are less expensive to build, but architects do like to design buildings in interesting shapes. Check out the Lipstick Building in New York or the Gherkin in London, or the Sydney Opera House. Tall buildings are more common in cities because they allow more people to live in a smaller space. They have to build vertically to fit more people in a small area. ?The footing, the space that the building takes is not that big, so they have to build up,? Janny says. The footing is like your footprint, the amount of space you take on the ground. Manhattan is built on a very strong rock, so it can support those tall buildings. Buildings stay up in much the same way humans stay up. There are footings--think of them like feet--that go into the ground. Buildings have a skeleton, called a structural frame, kind of like bones in a human. And on the outside, they have a cladding, aluminum or glass or other materials, kind of like our skin. Wind is a big consideration for architects building tall buildings. They design the buildings to sway. If buildings are too brittle they will break, they are designed to sway. Most skyscrapers get narrower toward the top. In earthquake prone areas, buildings sometimes have footings on a track so they can move. Activity Try making the tallest tower you possibly can, just using paper. (Newspaper works great if you have some newsprint lying around. But printer paper or construction paper is fine, too.) You should focus on making it strong and stable. Strong means that it can hold something. Stable means that if it?s pushed to the side it can stay upright. You can use cardboard for the base, but otherwise, see how you can do with just paper. Need a hint? Janny says to think about the ways you?d stay stable when playing sports.]]></description>

        <title><![CDATA[[RebelGirls] Mary Kom Read by Poorna Jagannathan]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there was a girl who grew up to be the most successful boxer in India?s history. Her name was Mary Kom. Mary was an energetic child who was naturally drawn towards sports. So she enrolled herself in a sports academy where she discovered her love of boxing, but her trainers thought she was too small. Still, Mary sparred until she improved her technique, showing up early and staying late to train. She was terrified her parents would stop her, but they eventually grew to be her biggest supporters. With her nation and family?s support, Mary boxed her way to the Olympic Games and inspired generations to come. [This episode originally aired March 2019.] About the Narrator: Poorna Jagannathan is an award-winning actress and producer. Critically acclaimed for her performance on HBO's "The Night Of," Jagannathan will soon be seen in season 2 of HBO's "Big Little Lies," and on Hulu's two most anticipated shows of 2019: "The Act" and "Ramy." Her past work on HBO's "Room 104" and AMC's Better Call Saul" garnered critical attention and some of her recent film credits include A24's "Share," directed by Pippa Bianco, Peter Berg's ?Mile 22,? and Aamir Kahn?s trailblazing Bollywood comedy, ?Delhi Belly,? for which she won a Stardust and a L?Oreal Femina award for best supporting actress. Jagannathan is the winner of the 2013 Amnesty International Award for the play ?Nirbhaya? by Yael Farber, which she initiated, produced and acted in. The play was called by The Telegraph as ?One of the most powerful pieces of theater you?ll ever see." Credits: This episode of Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls is produced by Elena Favilli, Joy Fowlkes, and Meg Murnane, with writing by Grace Boyle and narration by Poorna Jagannathan. Jestine Ware edited all scripts. Sound design and original theme music by Elettra Bargiacchi. Mattia Marcelli was the sound mixer.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[This episode is a real stinker, but it had to happen. We go behind the scenes on what makes butts and poop so funny. Why does the mere mention of them make us laugh?We all have butts and we all poop. Those are the facts. But human butts are different than almost any other animal. We look into the evolution of butts, and find out how our senses of humor develop when we&#39;re kids. And we hear from comic Tim Platt on why he thinks butts and poop will always be funny. Plus, we?ll check in with Channel 2?s Bowel Action News team for some fast feces facts.

        <title><![CDATA[[But Why] Why Are Fireworks Bright?]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[What are fireworks made of, why are they bright and loud, and how do people make them? And, why do Americans celebrate the 4th of July with fireworks? We learn about pyrotechnics with licensed fireworks professional John Steinberg. And David Chavez, an explosives expert at Los Alamos National Laboratory tells us how changes to the materials used in fireworks can make them better for the environment and unleash new, more vibrant colors in the night sky. We also address firework safety and how to impress your friends by knowing what kinds of metals are in the fireworks you?re watching or the sparklers you?re playing with. NOTE: We know not all kids (or adults) enjoy the noise of fireworks. We do play the sound of fireworks at the very beginning and very end of the episode. And John Steinberg offers some advice to people who dislike fireworks in the middle of the episode.

Resources: celebratesafely.org, Sparkler Safety Video, Fireworks Colors Why are fireworks bright? ?Dash, 4, Omaha, NE Steinberg told But Why that the brightness is the main purpose of fireworks. ?You?re painting the in sky with light. It has to be bright enough to create the color and the effect you want to in the sky. Second, fireworks are explosive. You can?t be right up in front of it like a painting in an art gallery. You have to be some distance away, so the fireworks have to be bright enough for you to appreciate it,? he said. Fireworks are created by burning materials that shine brightly when burned. Those fires are very hot! ?The types of things we burn in fireworks burn very brightly, and they?re chosen for those properties,? Steinberg said. Fireworks are created by a combustion in the sky ? a combustion is something that burns. ?You need a fuel and you need something to burn that fuel,? Chavez said. ?An example of a fuel would be gasoline or wood in a fireplace. In fireworks, the fuels are the chemicals that we use to make the firework itself. The oxidizer is another chemical. When those two things burn, they burn very hot. And those high temperatures excite the coloring agents that we have in fireworks.? The coloring agents are metals. ?Anytime you see red, that?s strontium. If you see a pinkish-purple, that?s potassium. Yellow is from sodium. Orange comes from calcium. The green is from barium, but now you can use boron. Blue is from copper. And these can be mixed to make other colors. ?You need a really hot fire to be able to excite these atoms, to make them give off their color. But when they are that hot, it makes the colors come out really bright.? Chavez and other scientists have found ways to change the fuel source of fireworks to create less soot. Those changes also allowed them to replace barium, which can get into water sources, with boron, a greener way to create those green fireworks. Support But Why | Newsletter Sign-Up]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Humans and every other living thing on Earth are perfectly suited to our wonderful planet. There?s life everywhere, from boiling-hot ocean vents to chilly mountain peaks. But what would life look like in other parts of the galaxy, or beyond? What would happen to our bodies if we lived in space?In an out-of-this-world episode, Molly and cohost Jaxson moonwalk through the possibilities of life in outer space. They learn what scientists look for when they want to know if a planet or moon could support life. And they explore how science fiction can help actual scientists think about what alien life might look like. Plus, a spiffy new Mystery Sound! This episode was sponsored by:Liquid I.V.

        <title><![CDATA[[But Why] Why do we donate blood?]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[One of the things that makes blood so special is we can share it with other people! Scientists and doctors have figured out safe ways to take the blood from one person and put it into the body of a different person who needs it. That?s called a transfusion. Why would someone need more blood? Doctors use blood transfusions to help people who have been in accidents and to treat people with certain kinds of cancer, sickle cell disease and other conditions. But if you?ve never heard about this before, it can sound kind of strange and alarming to think about giving away something that is so necessary to your life! In our second blood-related episode we?ll tag along with Jane as she donates some of her own blood. Download our learning guides: PDF | Google Slide | Transcript]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[In addition to having faces that look like a smiley emoticon, axolotls are as fascinating to scientific researchers as they are to kids because of their amazing ability to regenerate parts of their bodies, including their brains! In this episode we answer kids' questions about these curious salamanders with Dr. Randal Voss, a professor at the University of Kentucky. That lab alone has thousands of axolotls, but these creatures are critically endangered in the wild, where they live exclusively in the depleted and polluted waterways of Mexico City?s Lake Xochimilco. Questions we tackle in this episode: How do axolotls regrow parts of their brains? What did axolotls evolve from? Can axolotls survive out of water?

Today, you'll hear from Ruth Reichl who narrated the previous episode about Julia Child. If you haven't listened to last week's episode, now is a good time to go back and check it out. Ruth reveals how her partner supported her when she had career opportunities and her desired last meal! About The Narrator: Ruth Reichl, Gourmet's editor in chief, is the author of the best-selling memoirs Tender at the Bone, Comfort Me with Apples, and Garlic and Sapphires, and the forthcoming Not Becoming My Mother and Other Things She Taught Me Along the Way. She is executive producer of the two-time James Beard Award-winning Gourmet's Diary of a Foodie, which airs on public television across the country, and the editor of the Modern Library Food Series. Before coming to Gourmet, she was the restaurant critic for the New York Times, receiving two James Beard Awards for her work. She lectures frequently on food and culture. Credits: This episode of Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls is produced by Elena Favilli, Joy Fowlkes, John Cheary, Sarah Storm and Robin Lai. Sound design and original theme music by Elettra Bargiacchi. Mattia Marcelli was the sound mixer. Special thanks to our credit readers and interviewers.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Do insects see the world in slow motion? Do animals see the same rainbow we do? How do eagles see so far away? Our listeners have a lot of questions about the way animals see the world, and this episode tackles lots of them. We&#39;ll visit a lab where scientists are observing predatory insects to find out how their brains work, we&#39;ll drop in on the Eyes Open Wider support group for animals, and give you a catchy melody that will help you remember the electromagnetic spectrum -- that&#39;s all the light that&#39;s both visible and invisible to us.This episode was sponsored by:Elfster (Elfster.com/podcast - Set up a free Secret Santa gift exchange.)Shopify (Shopify.com/brainson - Sign up for a free 14-day trial and full access to Shopify&#39;s entire suite of features.)Storyworth (Storyworth.com/brains - Save $10 on your first purchase.)WOW in the World podcast by Wondery]]></description>

        <title><![CDATA[[But Why] Why do we have friends?]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[Why do friends care about each other? How do you make friends? Can you have more than one best friend? How do you deal with a bully? We answer questions about friends and bullies with Dr. Friendtastic (also known as Eileen Kennedy-Moore), a psychologist and author of Growing Friendships: A Kids? Guide to Making and Keeping Friends. And we get lots of advice from kids themselves about how to make friends and deal with bullies. Download our learning guides: PDF | Google Slide | Transcript Friendship is often about action. It's about what we do together, how we treat each other. The key to friendship is kindness. Best friends are nice, but the word ?best? can make it feel like a contest. Most people have different friends and for different situations. So it?s okay to have several close friends instead of needing to identify just one best friend. Some people have lots of friends, but other people may just have a few close friends. People with more friends tend to put more effort into having more friends. It?s okay to have a lot of friends or just a few! To make friends, you have to show an openness to friendship. That can be as easy as smiling or saying hi. It?s also important to be kind to potential friends. And it also helps to identify people who have similar interests to you. Then, invite them to do something. Kids make friends by doing fun things with other kids. Don?t wait until you feel close to someone to invite them to do something; you become close by doing shared activities. Shy people might be unintentionally sending the message to potential friends that they don?t like them. Stop focusing on being uncomfortable and instead look the other kid in the eye (or the forehead if eye contact is hard for you), smile and say hello. Practice it with an adult. At recess or on the playground, bigger groups of kids will be more open to you joining than groups with just two or three kids. Research shows that instead of asking if you can play with a big group, hang back and watch for a few minutes to figure out the game the other kids are playing, and then just join in. If you ask ?Can I play with you?? you risk interrupting the play. Bullying is deliberate (intentional) meanness directed at one person where there is an imbalance of power. For example, an older or more popular kid picking on a younger or less popular kid. It?s important to know the difference between bullying and meanness. Bullying requires adult intervention. If you?re having a problem with a friend that is not bullying, you may still want to talk that through with an adult, but it?s often possible to handle that conflict with your friend on your own.]]></description>

        <title><![CDATA[[But Why] Why Am I Afraid Of The Dark?]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[Lots of people are afraid of the dark, including many kids who have shared that fear with us. In today's episode we explore the fear of the dark with Daniel Handler, better known as Lemony Snicket, the author of the Series of Unfortunate Events books, and a picture book for young kids called The Dark. Then we go on a night hike with Vermont Fish and Wildlife biologist Steve Perren, to talk about ways to embrace the darkness. We practice our night vision by not using flashlights and we think about how our other senses can help us navigate. Steve also answers questions about how animals see in the dark and why it sometimes look like animals' eyes are glowing back at us in the darkness.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Today?s episode is all about your belly button aka navel aka umbilicus. And not just your belly button -- every single person you can think of has one. This means our listeners have LOTS of questions about them. We&#39;re going to tackle several of these fascinating navel-gazing questions like: is your belly button connected to your insides? Where does belly button fuzz come from? Why do some belly buttons stick out? And do cats and dogs have belly buttons? Plus, we have a tricky mystery sound for you to guess and a Moment of Um that answers the question: How do carrots grow if they don&#39;t have seeds?This episode was sponsored by:Indeed (indeed.com/brainson)]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Why is the heart a symbol of love? Why do people draw hearts when they love someone? Why do we draw hearts the way we do when they're nothing like the hearts inside of your body? And do we need a heart to love or does the brain do it? We?re learning all about hearts and symbolism with Thomas and Stephen Amidon, authors of The Sublime Engine: A Biography of the Human Heart. Download our learning guides: PDF | Google Slide | Transcript No one really knows where the heart symbol comes from, but there are theories. One is that the heart shape comes from the shape of the leaves of a now-extinct plant called silphium, which was considered a key component of a love potion in the time of the Romans. Another theory is that St. Valentine used the symbol when arranging secret marriages. Another is that it was simply a guess of what the human heart looked like. Love and other emotions are actually regulated in the brain, not the heart. Specifically, a part of the brain called the amygdala. People might partly associate the heart with strong emotions like love because when we get excited to see someone, our heart sometimes beats faster, and we notice our heartbeat. We aren?t really aware of what?s happening in our brain. The human heart pumps blood to all parts of your body. The heart beats once a second. If you live to the age of 70, your heart will have beat about 2 billion times!

        <title><![CDATA[[RebelGirls] Frida Kahlo Read By Pamela Adlon]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[(This episode originally aired 6/25/2018) Once upon a time, in a small town on the outskirts of Mexico City, there was a girl who lived in a blue house. Her name was Frida. From the outside, Frida's blue house was a common stucco building, with bright blue walls, tall windows, and green shutters. But past the entrance, a world of wonder awaited. THE HOST Pamela Fionna Adlon is an EMMY Award Winning American actress, voice actress, screenwriter, producer, and director. Pamela Adlon lent her voice to benefit the United Service Organization where Timbuktu made a donation in her name. CREDITS This episode was written by Francesca Cavallo, who is also a producer of the show with Elena Favilli. Sound design is by Elettra Bargiacchi.]]></description>

        <title><![CDATA[[BrainsOn] Happy: All about feelings, pt. 1]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[Where do feelings come from? And why do we have them? In this four-part series, we&#39;re digging deep into our emotions. In this first episode, we&#39;re getting happy! We&#39;ll get a play-by-play of the chemicals in our brain that trigger joyful feelings, and use the zoom ray to see what good vibes do for our bodies. We&#39;ll also hear about how each of us have different emotional thermostats and why thinking about our feelings can help us figure out what to do with them. At the end of this episode -- and every episode in this series -- Mallika Chopra shares a meditation that can help us manage our feelings. For more on meditation and mindfulness, you can check out Mallika Chopra?s book for kids, Just Breathe.This episode is sponsored by Old El Paso, Rebel Girls the Podcast (rebelgirls.co/podcast), Relay (relaygo.com/BRAINS for 15% your Relay purchase on Amazon) and New Cloud Control Cat Litter by Arm &amp; Hammer.]]></description>

        <title><![CDATA[[RebelGirls] Joan Jett Read By Donita Sparks]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[[This episode originally aired August, 2021.] Although Joan Jett has been called the ?Godmother of punk,? this rocker?s rise to super stardom came with plenty of twists and turns. From the time Joan picked up her first electric guitar at age 13 in 1971, she was met with the refrain that ?girls don?t play guitars??and that they certainly don?t play rock. Joan spent the rest of her life proving these naysayers wrong, founding one of the first all-girl rock bands at age 16 before skyrocketing to the top of the charts as the frontwoman of Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. About the Narrator Donita Sparks is a singer, songwriter, guitarist, writer and actor. She first rose to fame with legendary all female American rock band, L7, which remains active to this day. Sparks was instilled at a young age with a keen sense of political and social activism. She, along with her bandmates, founded Rock for Choice, a pro-choice organization with the Feminist Majority Foundation producing numerous nationwide benefit concerts. She is particularly known for her raucous live performances and rebellious persona.

        <description><![CDATA[A lot of us are angry right now, with good reason. We?re seeing people treated unfairly because of racism -- that?s when people don?t like someone?s race or the color of their skin.In this episode we?ll talk about how anger can be a useful emotion and can be used to push for change. We?ll also revisit parts of our 2019 series on emotions, including an explanation of the hormones behind anger, why some of us are quicker to anger than others and what we can do when we feel overwhelmed by our feelings. Plus, our Moment of Um tackles the question, ?What happens when lightning strikes water??If you want to talk to your kids about race but don?t know where to start, we suggest reading this article (https://bit.ly/3eEss5k) by pediatricians Dr. Jacqueline Doug?, &amp; Dr. Ashaunta Anderson or Talking to Kids About Race by Heather Greenwood Davis (https://on.natgeo.com/306a2Xe).There are great books to help your family start a conversation about race. Here&#39;s a list from Embrace Race (https://bit.ly/2U1SvLV). Or try Brown Bookshelf&#39;s Generations Book Club (https://bit.ly/3gSljA3).This episode is sponsored by Laurel Springs (laurelsprings.com/brainson) and KiwiCo (kiwico.com/brainson).

        <description><![CDATA[A fire can be super useful or cozy or even magical. But it can also be dangerous -- and in the case of wildfires, if they burn long and hot enough, they can destroy ecosystems and send lots of harmful smoke into the air. In this episode, we&#39;re going to find out why wildfires are getting bigger and why wildfire season is lasting longer now. We&#39;ll learn how the tribes who&#39;ve lived in what is now called Northern California managed the forests and kept fire in check for thousands of years, and how those practices are being used today. We&#39;ll hear from a friendly house about how to stay safe from smoke inside and find out how firefighters work to contain fires once they&#39;ve started. Plus, our Moment of Um answers the question: Is the name of a letter considered a word?This episode is sponsored by Bobby Wonder, a podcast from GoKidGo.

        <description><![CDATA[Geppetto always wanted a child of his own, so when he found a magical talking log, he decided to make his dream come true. He chiseled away and lo and behold, his child came to life! But he got two things wrong. Pinocchio wasn't a girl and he didn't want to be made of wood. Run along with Pinocchio as he sings for an adoring audience, celebrates his birthday everyday on Toyland, leads an army of kid donkeys, gets sucked into the belly of an enormous whale, and with the help of his friend Blue Fairy, discovers the love he and his Dad share. Based on the Italian children's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio, this story of a transgender boy will be sure to warm your heart.

        <description><![CDATA[Have you ever been threading one leg through a pair of pants in the morning and wondered?why do we wear pants anyway? Or wondered why pockets in clothing designed for girls are sometimes smaller than the pockets in clothing designed for boys? In this episode we?ll tackle your questions about clothes with fashion historian and writer Amber Butchart. Download our learning guides: PDF | Google Slides | Transcript ?Why do we have to wear clothes?? - Bhakti, 9, Australia Many people think we started to wear clothes for practical reasons of warmth and protection. ?We don?t have fur like other animals, so when modern humans started moving into colder parts of the world, we needed to protect ourselves somehow if it?s cold and snowy. This is one answer, that we wear clothes for protection,? said Amber Butchart. Butchart is a dress historian, author and broadcaster. She studies how the clothes we wear are connected to where we live and what kind of culture we grow up in, and what time period we?re growing up and living in. Butchart says, while the protection theory explains why we have to wear something?to cover our skin from the elements, there are a lot of other answers that help explain the style of clothes we wear, or don?t wear. These have to do with culture and society, and ideas about modesty as well. In this case modesty means what?s considered proper, broadly accepted as not being too wild or ?out there.? A lot of how we dress comes down to what is considered appropriate in our current culture. ?The idea is that these cultural codes built up across millennia and centuries and centuries, ideas that parts of our body should be covered up,? Butchart explained. ?We have these social ideas to do with what parts of the body should and shouldn?t be on display, but we also have that combined with this need, especially in colder parts of the world, for protection from the elements.? But when it comes to fashion, what you wear communicates something about you to the outside world, and clothing has gone through many changes throughout history. Listen to the episode to learn more!

        <title><![CDATA[[But Why] Why do crickets chirp?]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[How are crickets so loud? Why do they chirp at night? How are they different from grasshoppers? We?re talking crickets today with Karim Vahed, a cricket and katydid expert and entomologist (bug scientist) at the University of Derby in the United Kingdom. Professor Vahed also takes on some of your pressing insect questions: Do insects have bones? What do baby bugs like to do? Do insects drink water? Why are bugs so important? Download our learning guides: PDF | Google Slide | Transcript There are over 9,000 known species of crickets on the planet. These insects are best known for singing and hopping! Insects are divided into different orders depending on what kind they are. Crickets are in the order known as Orthoptera, which contains grasshoppers, locusts, crickets and bush crickets, and katydids. Crickets and grasshoppers are different! For one thing, most grasshoppers make noise by rubbing one of their legs against one of their wings. But most crickets make sound by rubbing their two forewings (their front wings) together. One wing is jagged, like a little row of teeth. And the other wing kind of scrapes up against it, making a sound. The number of teeth on the scraper, the speed of the rubbing and how frequently they make the chirps differ depending on the species. So there are lots of different cricket songs. Try an experiment: Get a comb and run your fingernail across it. See if you can make a sound. If you have more than one comb, or a comb with two differently sized/spaced teeth, see if they make different sounds. Does the size of the fingernail make a difference in the sound? Try giving your comb to an adult and find out! In most cricket species, the males chirp to attract a female. And they mostly sing at night to help avoid predators. But Karim Vahed says some studies have shown that predators like domestic house cats follow the chirps of the crickets to find and eat them! Imagine a cricket the size of a hamster! A cricket so big it would cover the palm of your hand if you were holding it. The giant w?t? [say it: WEH-tah] is that insect! There are several species of giant w?t?s. They all live in New Zealand and most of them are protected because they?re quite rare. Insects are the most diverse group of animals on the planet. There are more than a million known species (about 80% of all known animals). But scientists estimate anywhere from 10 million to 80 million insect species have yet to be discovered!]]></description>

        <title><![CDATA[How do computers store so much info in such a tiny space?]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[If you translate ?Hello! How are you?? to binary code, it looks like this: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001 00100000 01001000 01101111 01110111 00100000 01100001 01110010 01100101 00100000 01111001 01101111 01110101 00111111 This episode takes a look at how computers can do so much with such tiny parts. But computers weren&#39;t always small -- so we take a look at where computers came from. We visit Ada Lovelace, whose love of math and weaving paved the way for modern-day computers. And we hear about the material that let computers shrink from the size of a room to something that fits in our pockets. There?s also a visit from a yak and a ram, but you?re just going to have to listen to find out why.All that plus a new Mystery Sound and Moment of Um that answers the question: what is the flavor of root beer?This episode is sponsored by Mathnasium (Mathnasium.com) and Sun Basket (sunbasket.com promo code: brains on)]]></description>
