        <description><![CDATA[What is it like to be an adult? It's a big question from a young mind! We invited adults who listen to share their perspectives and Nora McInerny, host of the podcast Terrible, Thanks for Asking, helps guide us through that and a few other questions about the strange world of adults: Why can adults do things that kids can't do? Why don't adults play pretend like they used to when they were kids? What happens when you don't listen to your boss? And why do people cry when they're happy?]]></description>

        <title><![CDATA[[BrainsOn] What causes wildfires?]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[A fire can be super useful or cozy or even magical. But it can also be dangerous -- and in the case of wildfires, if they burn long and hot enough, they can destroy ecosystems and send lots of harmful smoke into the air. In this episode, we&#39;re going to find out why wildfires are getting bigger and why wildfire season is lasting longer now. We&#39;ll learn how the tribes who&#39;ve lived in what is now called Northern California managed the forests and kept fire in check for thousands of years, and how those practices are being used today. We&#39;ll hear from a friendly house about how to stay safe from smoke inside and find out how firefighters work to contain fires once they&#39;ve started. Plus, our Moment of Um answers the question: Is the name of a letter considered a word?This episode is sponsored by Bobby Wonder, a podcast from GoKidGo.

        <description><![CDATA[Geppetto always wanted a child of his own, so when he found a magical talking log, he decided to make his dream come true. He chiseled away and lo and behold, his child came to life! But he got two things wrong. Pinocchio wasn't a girl and he didn't want to be made of wood. Run along with Pinocchio as he sings for an adoring audience, celebrates his birthday everyday on Toyland, leads an army of kid donkeys, gets sucked into the belly of an enormous whale, and with the help of his friend Blue Fairy, discovers the love he and his Dad share. Based on the Italian children's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio, this story of a transgender boy will be sure to warm your heart.

        <title><![CDATA[[But Why] Why Do We Wear Clothes?]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[Have you ever been threading one leg through a pair of pants in the morning and wondered?why do we wear pants anyway? Or wondered why pockets in clothing designed for girls are sometimes smaller than the pockets in clothing designed for boys? In this episode we?ll tackle your questions about clothes with fashion historian and writer Amber Butchart. Download our learning guides: PDF | Google Slides | Transcript ?Why do we have to wear clothes?? - Bhakti, 9, Australia Many people think we started to wear clothes for practical reasons of warmth and protection. ?We don?t have fur like other animals, so when modern humans started moving into colder parts of the world, we needed to protect ourselves somehow if it?s cold and snowy. This is one answer, that we wear clothes for protection,? said Amber Butchart. Butchart is a dress historian, author and broadcaster. She studies how the clothes we wear are connected to where we live and what kind of culture we grow up in, and what time period we?re growing up and living in. Butchart says, while the protection theory explains why we have to wear something?to cover our skin from the elements, there are a lot of other answers that help explain the style of clothes we wear, or don?t wear. These have to do with culture and society, and ideas about modesty as well. In this case modesty means what?s considered proper, broadly accepted as not being too wild or ?out there.? A lot of how we dress comes down to what is considered appropriate in our current culture. ?The idea is that these cultural codes built up across millennia and centuries and centuries, ideas that parts of our body should be covered up,? Butchart explained. ?We have these social ideas to do with what parts of the body should and shouldn?t be on display, but we also have that combined with this need, especially in colder parts of the world, for protection from the elements.? But when it comes to fashion, what you wear communicates something about you to the outside world, and clothing has gone through many changes throughout history. Listen to the episode to learn more!

        <title><![CDATA[[But Why] Why do crickets chirp?]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[How are crickets so loud? Why do they chirp at night? How are they different from grasshoppers? We?re talking crickets today with Karim Vahed, a cricket and katydid expert and entomologist (bug scientist) at the University of Derby in the United Kingdom. Professor Vahed also takes on some of your pressing insect questions: Do insects have bones? What do baby bugs like to do? Do insects drink water? Why are bugs so important? Download our learning guides: PDF | Google Slide | Transcript There are over 9,000 known species of crickets on the planet. These insects are best known for singing and hopping! Insects are divided into different orders depending on what kind they are. Crickets are in the order known as Orthoptera, which contains grasshoppers, locusts, crickets and bush crickets, and katydids. Crickets and grasshoppers are different! For one thing, most grasshoppers make noise by rubbing one of their legs against one of their wings. But most crickets make sound by rubbing their two forewings (their front wings) together. One wing is jagged, like a little row of teeth. And the other wing kind of scrapes up against it, making a sound. The number of teeth on the scraper, the speed of the rubbing and how frequently they make the chirps differ depending on the species. So there are lots of different cricket songs. Try an experiment: Get a comb and run your fingernail across it. See if you can make a sound. If you have more than one comb, or a comb with two differently sized/spaced teeth, see if they make different sounds. Does the size of the fingernail make a difference in the sound? Try giving your comb to an adult and find out! In most cricket species, the males chirp to attract a female. And they mostly sing at night to help avoid predators. But Karim Vahed says some studies have shown that predators like domestic house cats follow the chirps of the crickets to find and eat them! Imagine a cricket the size of a hamster! A cricket so big it would cover the palm of your hand if you were holding it. The giant w?t? [say it: WEH-tah] is that insect! There are several species of giant w?t?s. They all live in New Zealand and most of them are protected because they?re quite rare. Insects are the most diverse group of animals on the planet. There are more than a million known species (about 80% of all known animals). But scientists estimate anywhere from 10 million to 80 million insect species have yet to be discovered!]]></description>

How are you?? to binary code, it looks like this: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001 00100000 01001000 01101111 01110111 00100000 01100001 01110010 01100101 00100000 01111001 01101111 01110101 00111111 This episode takes a look at how computers can do so much with such tiny parts. But computers weren&#39;t always small -- so we take a look at where computers came from. We visit Ada Lovelace, whose love of math and weaving paved the way for modern-day computers. And we hear about the material that let computers shrink from the size of a room to something that fits in our pockets. There?s also a visit from a yak and a ram, but you?re just going to have to listen to find out why.All that plus a new Mystery Sound and Moment of Um that answers the question: what is the flavor of root beer?This episode is sponsored by Mathnasium (Mathnasium.com) and Sun Basket (sunbasket.com promo code: brains on)]]></description>
